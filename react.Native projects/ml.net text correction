You can use ML.NET to build a text correction model that can be used for paraphrasing. The model can be trained on a dataset of text and its corrected version. Here's how you can do it:

1. Prepare your training data: You'll need a dataset of text and its corrected version. You can manually create this dataset or use an existing one. Ideally, the dataset should be large and diverse.

2. Install ML.NET: You can install ML.NET using NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.

3. Define your model: In this case, you'll use a transformer-based model for text generation. You can use GPT-2 or BERT models available in ML.NET.

4. Train your model: You'll need to split your dataset into training and validation sets. You can then train your model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set. You can use techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the performance of your model.

5. Fine-tune your model: Once you've trained your model, you can fine-tune it on a smaller dataset of text to improve its performance on specific tasks. For example, you can fine-tune your model on a dataset of text related to a particular subject or domain.

6. Deploy your model: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, you can deploy it in your application. You can use ML.NET's model builder to create a binary file of your model and use it in your application.

Overall, building a text correction model for paraphrasing using ML.NET involves defining your model, preparing your dataset, training your model, fine-tuning it, and deploying it in your application.

Here is an example of code you can use to build the text paraphrasing machine learning model with ML.NET, which we then will forward into our mobile app.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.ML;
using Microsoft.ML.Data;
using Microsoft.ML.Transforms.Text;

// Define the input and output classes
public class InputData
{
    [ColumnName("Text"), LoadColumn(0)]
    public string Text { get; set; }
}

public class OutputData
{
    [ColumnName("Label"), LoadColumn(1)]
    public string Label { get; set; }
}

// Define the training program
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a new MLContext
        var context = new MLContext();

        // Load the training data
        var data = context.Data.LoadFromTextFile<InputData>("training-data.txt", separatorChar: '\t', hasHeader: true);

        // Split the data into training and testing sets
        var trainTestSplit = context.Data.TrainTestSplit(data);

        // Define the data preparation pipeline
        var pipeline = context.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(outputColumnName: "Features", inputColumnName: nameof(InputData.Text))
            .Append(context.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey(outputColumnName: "LabelKey", inputColumnName: nameof(OutputData.Label)))
            .Append(context.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "LabelKey", "FeaturesWithLabel"))
            .Append(context.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax("FeaturesWithLabel", "FeaturesWithLabel"))
            .Append(context.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue("PredictedLabel", "PredictedLabel"));

        // Train the model
        var trainer = context.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.SdcaNonCalibrated();
        var trainedModel = pipeline.Append(trainer.Fit(trainTestSplit.TrainSet));

        // Evaluate the model
        var predictions = trainedModel.Transform(trainTestSplit.TestSet);
        var metrics = context.MulticlassClassification.Evaluate(predictions);

        Console.WriteLine($"Accuracy: {metrics.MacroAccuracy}");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `InputData` class represents the input text data, and the `OutputData` class represents the corrected and paraphrased text. The training data is loaded from a text file, and the `FeaturizeText` transform is used to convert the text data into numeric features that can be used to train the model. The `MapValueToKey` transform is used to convert the output labels into integer keys, and the `Concatenate` transform is used to combine the text features with the label keys. The `NormalizeMinMax` transform is used to scale the features, and the `MapKeyToValue` transform is used to convert the predicted label keys back into string labels. Finally, the `SdcaNonCalibrated` trainer is used to train the multiclass classification model, and the `Evaluate` method is used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

The above example shows how to train an ML.NET model using an existing dataset. To continue learning and training the model, you would need to gather more data and retrain the model on the new data. 

Here are some steps you can take to train an ML.NET model:

1. Collect more data: The first step is to collect more data that you can use to train your model. This could be in the form of more text data that you want to use to improve the model's performance.
```
List<TextData> newData = new List<TextData>();
// add new text data to newData list
```

2. Clean and preprocess the data: Once you have collected the data, you will need to clean and preprocess it to ensure that it is ready for training. This might involve removing any unwanted characters or words, converting the text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
```
var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.Text
    .NormalizeText("Text", "NormalizedText", keepDiacritics: false, keepPunctuations: false, keepNumbers: true)
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.TokenizeIntoWords("Tokens", "NormalizedText"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.RemoveDefaultStopWords("Tokens"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText("Features", "Tokens"));
var newDataView = mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(newData);
var preprocessedData = pipeline.Fit(newDataView).Transform(newDataView);
```

3. Split the data into training and testing sets: Next, you will need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
```
var trainTestData = mlContext.Data.TrainTestSplit(preprocessedData, testFraction: 0.3);
var trainData = trainTestData.TrainSet;
var testData = trainTestData.TestSet;
```

4. Train the model: Once you have preprocessed your data and split it into training and testing sets, you can train the model using the ML.NET API. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, setting any necessary hyperparameters, and specifying the training data.
```
var predictions = trainedModel.Transform(testData);
var metrics = mlContext.BinaryClassification.Evaluate(predictions);
Console.WriteLine($"Accuracy: {metrics.Accuracy}");
```

5. Evaluate the model: Once the model has been trained, you can evaluate its performance using the testing set. This will give you an idea of how well the model is likely to perform on new data.
```
var predictions = trainedModel.Transform(testData);
var metrics = mlContext.BinaryClassification.Evaluate(predictions);
Console.WriteLine($"Accuracy: {metrics.Accuracy}");
```

6. Refine the model: Depending on the results of the evaluation, you may need to refine the model further. This could involve collecting more data, selecting a different algorithm, or adjusting the hyperparameters.

7. Deploy the model: Once you are happy with the performance of your model, you can deploy it and use it to make predictions on new data.
```
var modelPath = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "model.zip");
mlContext.Model.Save(trainedModel, trainData.Schema, modelPath);
// use the model to make predictions on new data
```

Training an ML.NET model is an iterative process that involves collecting and preprocessing data, selecting an appropriate algorithm, and refining the model based on its performance. With each iteration, the model should become more accurate and better able to make predictions on new data.

As we continue on to the next lesson, we'll learn how this can help and bolster someones ability to improve social interactions and improve their ability to mask in our social masking application.
