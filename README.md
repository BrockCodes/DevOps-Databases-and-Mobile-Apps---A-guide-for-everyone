# DevOps-Databases-and-Mobile-Apps---A-guide-for-everyone
## A guide for DevOps, Database Admins and Mobile Application developers. - Build and host your own architecture from on premise to the cloud to manage full-stack architecture and applications.

### This is a guide for everyone, from the student learning to be a Full-Stack Developer, to the seasoned Mobile or Web Developer to the Director of Engineering. Many technologies will be touched on towards the enterprise administration levels, you can read this book with the intent of learning everything, or you can read technology to technology. Sections of the book will be organized by main subject or technology, and then each subject will be broken down into its own series of chapters. 

### You can read this for a single Subject, or use it as a reference for many. This book will include numerous subjects that are made so a level an engineering student can easily pick up or a seasoned engineer or manager can grab and handle things on the go.

If you intend to use this guide from the start to finish, I do recommend the following order:
